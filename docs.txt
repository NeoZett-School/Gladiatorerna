# Section 2 - Player

> Characters:
Default is Jim.

As the player, you can select your character.
With any given character, the specialization will be different.

> Stats:
Statistics such as max health.

Levels will increase certain stats. Gain exp to gain levels.
To gain exp, you'll have to go to the arena.
Max health is dynamic to whatever shielding you might 
have equipped during the fights. 

---

# Section 3 - Enemy

> Generation:
The creation of your enemy.

Enemies level will be dynamic to the players.
Depending on what level the enemy gets, they will 
also have the chance to get more advanced weapons.
They may only have at max, the the same amount of 
weapon and armor with the same level as the player, 
but it is randomised with a minimum as one.

Depending on the name for the enemy, the enemy 
will have different fight dialogs.

---

# Section 4 - Items

> Health:
The health of your items.

Weapons will have a health and max health. When 
you reach negative health (or zero), you cannot 
use that weapon until it has been repaired (recharged, 
if you will). Armor will also have a health. 
This will be gathered as the players "protection".
If the protection reaches zero (and only then) 
will the damage decrement the health for that part.

All health, also for the two parties (players - enemy 
counts as a player) will regenerate based on 
internal stats.

---

# Section 5 - Rewards

The rewards are dynamic to what level the player is.
Higher levels gives higher rewards, since higher levels 
also provides more dangerous enemies, and also since 
the user (player) will likely have their weapons and 
armor upgraded or new.

---

# Section 6 - Loss

The loss will always be a quarter of what you could win.

---

# Section 7 - Shop

There are two categories: 
Weapons, and Armor.

Make sure to gather enough points to buy new gear and 
progress further through the game.

---

# Section 8 - Inventory

In your inventory, you can equip or unequip any of your 
bought items.

---

# Section 9 - Blacksmith

You can upgrade your bought items instead of buying new. 
Just make sure that the new item doesn't outweight upgrading 
another old one. You could also use different weapons for 
different strategies.

---

# Section 10 - Inspection

Inspect all items and your player.

Everything you might want to know will be available here. 
Just open the inspection menu and you can scroll through 
all statistics.

---

# Section 11 - About and documentation

Here, you will find appropiate information about this 
project. For more information, locate the readme and 
go to the github page, featured in the "about" section.

# Section 12 - In-game fights

Open up a fight and you will find a lot of new elements.

To distinguish what is what, we have this documentation.

At the top, we find the enemy name, his 
level and what round we are playing.

Beneath this, you will also find a log for whenever you 
make a move. This will show how much damage you and the 
enemy did, along with what item they did so. If you leave 
and then enter the arena again, only the log will be gone, 
but the enemy will be the same unless the fight ended.

If you look under this, you will find the current health 
and protection for both you and the enemy.

The last two sections are not very important. The first 
one is the interactive story, making all fun. Then comes 
the enemy attack dialog. This will be a simple explanation 
of what the enemy tried doing.

Lastly, we have the interface for what you will do next.
We have all equipped weapons, their health and a short 
description explaning what it means to select that item.

If you don't enter anything, that means that you will do 
nothing. But, be aware, the enemy may still attack.

The repairs on your items (armor and weapons) are statistics 
dependent on what item it is and what upgrade (Blacksmith grade) 
they are, along with other statistics. The longer you wait 
between your attacks, the more will these items get repaired. 
That is why this game makes for a perfect timing and fighting 
text-console gladiator game, with in-game points and other 
engaging features.
