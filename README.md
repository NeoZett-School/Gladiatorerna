# Gladiatorerna

Follow us on our progress! This is for a course.

### What is this about?

In this project, we have been given a task to recreate the once popular game of the gladiators in ancient [*__Rome__*](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome). To do so, we've been given the python programming language, a computer and a programming environment. This game will be made as a text-based game, but I still believe you might like it.

What it has to offer:

- `**Characters**`: Play as different characters, specialized at different game-styles.
- `**Difficulties**`: Comes with easy, normal and hard. Chose wheter you want to feel the game, or fight for survival.
- `**Touch of nature**`: Fight against lions, bears or barbarians! Easily extend the game to your own liking.
- `**Political**`: You may have a second chance. Only if the emperor says so.
- `**Be the strongest**`: Buy new and flashy weapons. Nothing is overpowered with a dust of chance sprinkled over it.
