Follow our journey as we bring the ancient arena back to life — this project is part of a programming course, but also a battle for glory. ⚔️

## 🧠 What Is This About?  

In this project, we’ve been tasked with recreating the once-popular gladiator games of ancient [**Rome**](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome).  
Armed only with **Python**, a computer, and an **IDE**, we’re building a **text-based gladiator game** — simple in form, but rich in challenge and spirit.

## 🎮 What It Has to Offer  

- **`Characters`** — Play as different fighters, each with unique traits and fighting styles.  
- **`Difficulties`** — Choose between *Easy*, *Normal*, or *Hard*. Feel the thrill — or fight for survival.  
- **`Touch of Nature`** — Face wild beasts such as lions, bears, or barbarians! The system is easily extendable for new foes.   
- **`Be the Strongest`** — Earn gold and buy new weapons and armor. Nothing is overpowered — just a bit of luck and skill.  
We removed `Political`. You might have noticed that this game is more about fighting than it is about pleasing a emperor.
